# Reinforcement Learning and Regression Enhanced ADRC for Mobile Robot Control

This repository contains MATLAB/Simulink models and scripts for trajectory tracking control of a **Differential Drive Mobile Robot (DDMR)**.  
The project integrates **Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC)** with **Time Series Regression (TSR)** and **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DDPG)** to enable adaptive, automated tuning of ADRC parameters.

The work is based on the paper *‚ÄúEnhancing Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking with Time Series Regression and Reinforcement Learning‚Äù*.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Mobile Robot Kinematics & Dynamics**: Forward and inverse kinematics, dynamic modeling with motor torque inputs.  
- **ADRC Controller**: Extended State Observer (ESO) + Nonlinear State Error Feedback (NLSEF) for robust disturbance rejection.  
- **Time Series Regression (TSR)**: LSTM model predicts future states (x, y, Œ∏) to enhance control performance.  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) agent tunes ADRC parameters (Kp, Kd, œâo) online.  
- **Trajectory Tracking**: Circular path tracking under various disturbances (step, pulse, sinusoidal).  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Comparison between manually tuned ADRC and RL+Regression-enhanced ADRC.
